## Key Findings

### Architectural Differences

| Aspect | Sonos | Plugwise (Current) | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Structure** | Clean separation | Everything nested | Adopt Sonos pattern |
| **MCP Folder** | Server only | Everything | Move domain logic out |
| **Services** | Root level | In mcp/ | Move to root |
| **Types** | Root level | In mcp/ | Move to root |
| **Client** | Root level | In mcp/ | Move to root |
| **Output** | dist/ | build/ | Rename to dist/ |

### Recommended Changes

#### ‚úÖ Adopt from Sonos
1. **Folder Structure**: Move services/, types/, client/, config/ to src root
2. **Build Output**: Use `dist/` instead of `build/`
3. **Testing**: Add vitest for unit testing
4. **NPM Scripts**: Add prepare, test, typecheck scripts
5. **Code Quality**: Consider adding eslint and prettier

#### ‚úÖ Keep from Plugwise
1. **Separate Tool Files**: Better organization than inline tools
2. **MCP Features**: Keep resources and prompts in mcp/
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive docs approach
4. **Integration Tests**: Keep demo/test scripts

## Migration Plan Overview

### Timeline: 5-7 hours

1. **Phase 1** (30 min): Create new folder structure
2. **Phase 2** (30 min): Move files to new locations
3. **Phase 3** (15 min): Create index.ts files for exports
4. **Phase 4** (1-2 hours): Update all import statements
5. **Phase 5** (30 min): Update build configuration
6. **Phase 6** (1 hour): Add testing infrastructure
7. **Phase 7** (1 hour): Update documentation
8. **Phase 8** (30 min): Final verification and testing

### Target Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts              # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/               # NEW: HTTP/API client
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/             # MOVED: Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                # MOVED: Type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/               # MOVED: Configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp/                  # MCP-specific only
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
```

## Benefits of Migration

### üéØ High Impact
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between MCP and domain logic
- **Testability**: Services can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and understand
- **Standards**: Follows NPM and TypeScript conventions

### üìà Medium Impact
- **Reusability**: Domain code can be used in other contexts (CLI, REST API)
- **Documentation**: Clearer structure reflected in docs
- **Onboarding**: Easier for new contributors to understand

### ‚ú® Low Impact (Future)
- **Tree-shaking**: Better for package consumers
- **Tooling**: Standard structure works better with IDEs

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking imports | Medium | High | Careful search/replace, incremental testing |
| Build failures | Low | High | Update configs before building |
| Lost functionality | Low | Critical | Git history, comprehensive testing |
| Documentation drift | Medium | Low | Update docs as part of migration |

**Overall Risk**: LOW (with proper execution following checklist)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready to Execute)
1. ‚úÖ Review all migration documents
2. ‚è≥ Create feature branch
3. ‚è≥ Execute Phase 1-8 using checklist
4. ‚è≥ Test thoroughly
5. ‚è≥ Merge to main

### Future Enhancements
1. üîÆ Add vitest unit tests
2. üîÆ Add eslint and prettier
3. üîÆ Create more integration tests
4. üîÆ Add GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Recommendations

### Priority: HIGH
**Execute this migration in the next development cycle**

**Why:**
1. Improves code organization significantly
2. Aligns with industry best practices
3. Makes testing easier (foundation for quality)
4. Relatively low risk with proper execution
5. Prevents technical debt accumulation

### Execution Approach
1. Use the detailed checklist
2. Work in a feature branch
3. Test incrementally after each phase
4. Don't skip documentation updates
5. Merge only when all tests pass

### Post-Migration
1. Add unit tests (now easier with new structure)
2. Consider adding code quality tools
3. Update CI/CD if applicable
4. Publish new version to npm

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Will this break existing installations?
**A:** No. This is an internal restructuring. The public API (MCP tools, resources, prompts) remains the same. Published package will still work identically.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A:** 5-7 hours of focused work following the checklist. Can be done in one session or split across multiple days.

### Q: What if something goes wrong?
**A:** Git history preserves everything. Simple rollback: `git reset --hard <before-migration-commit>`. Working in a feature branch provides additional safety.

### Q: Do we need to update the version?
**A:** Yes, recommend a minor version bump (1.0.2 ‚Üí 1.1.0) since it's a structural change. No breaking changes to public API though.

### Q: Can we do this incrementally?
**A:** Not recommended. The import changes are interconnected. Better to complete all phases in sequence. However, you can pause between phases if needed.

## Success Metrics

After migration completion:
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] All tools still work as before
- [ ] MCP server starts successfully
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Published package works in test environment
- [ ] No regression in functionality

## Conclusion

This investigation has produced a comprehensive, actionable migration plan that will significantly improve the Plugwise MCP codebase organization. The plan is:

‚úÖ **Well-documented** - Five detailed documents covering all aspects  
‚úÖ **Low-risk** - Clear rollback plan and incremental testing  
‚úÖ **High-value** - Improves maintainability, testability, and standards compliance  
‚úÖ **Ready to execute** - Step-by-step checklist provided  
‚úÖ **Validated** - Based on proven patterns from sonos-ts-mcp  

**Recommendation:** Proceed with migration in the next development cycle.
