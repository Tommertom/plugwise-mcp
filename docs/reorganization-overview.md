# Reorganized Codebase Overview

## Summary

The Plugwise MCP Server has been successfully reorganized from a monolithic structure into a maintainable, modular architecture. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the new structure.

## What Changed

### Before
- **1 file**: `server.ts` (~900 lines)
- Everything mixed together
- Hard to maintain
- Difficult to test
- Hard to understand

### After
- **17 files** organized in 5 directories
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Testable components
- Clear, understandable structure

## Component Responsibilities

### server.ts
**Purpose**: Application bootstrap and orchestration

**Responsibilities**:
- Create service instances
- Register tools, resources, prompts
- Set up Express HTTP server
- Define health check endpoint
- Start the server

**Size**: ~130 lines (was ~900)

### config/environment.ts
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration management

**Responsibilities**:
- Load environment variables
- Parse and validate configuration
- Provide typed configuration interfaces
- Hub credential management

### services/hub-discovery.service.ts
**Purpose**: Hub discovery and registry

**Responsibilities**:
- Load hubs from `.env` file
- Network scanning for hubs
- Maintain hub registry
- Hub lookup by IP

**Used by**: scan-network and connection tools

### services/connection.service.ts
**Purpose**: Active connection management

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain single active connection
- Connection state management
- Provide connection to tools
- Ensure connection exists

**Used by**: All tools that need Plugwise API access

### tools/
**Purpose**: MCP tool implementations

**Files**:
- `scan-network.tool.ts` - Network scanning
- `connection.tool.ts` - Gateway connection
- `device.tool.ts` - Device information
- `temperature.tool.ts` - Temperature/preset control
- `switch.tool.ts` - Switch control
- `gateway.tool.ts` - Gateway operations
- `index.ts` - Registration aggregator

**Pattern**: Each tool in its own file

### resources/
**Purpose**: MCP resource implementations

**Files**:
- `devices.resource.ts` - Device data resource
- `index.ts` - Registration aggregator

**Pattern**: Each resource in its own file

### prompts/
**Purpose**: MCP prompt implementations

**Files**:
- `setup-guide.prompt.ts` - Setup guide
- `index.ts` - Registration aggregator

**Pattern**: Each prompt in its own file

## Key Benefits

- Small, focused files
- Easy to locate code
- Clear file names
- Logical organization

### 2. Testability ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Services are isolated
- Dependencies are injected
- Easy to mock
- Clear interfaces

### 3. Scalability ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Simple to add new tools
- No merge conflicts
- Parallel development
- Clean extension points

### 4. Readability ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Clear structure
- Self-documenting file names
- Consistent patterns
- Well-commented

### 5. Developer Experience ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Fast to understand
- Easy to navigate
- Clear patterns
- Good IDE support

## How It Works

### Application Startup Flow
```
1. Load .env file (dotenv)
2. Create service instances
   - HubDiscoveryService
   - ConnectionService
3. Load hubs from environment
   - HubDiscoveryService.loadFromEnvironment()
4. Create MCP Server instance
5. Register all tools (registerAllTools)
6. Register all resources (registerAllResources)
7. Register all prompts (registerAllPrompts)
8. Start Express server
9. Server ready to handle requests
```

### Request Flow Example
```
MCP Client
  ↓ POST /mcp
Express Server
  ↓ route to handler
MCP Server (SDK)
  ↓ dispatch to tool
Tool Implementation (e.g., temperature.tool.ts)
  ↓ ensure connection
Connection Service
  ↓ return client
Tool
  ↓ API call
Plugwise Client
  ↓ HTTP request
Plugwise Gateway
  ↓ execute command
Response flows back
```

## Patterns to Follow

### Adding a New Tool
1. Create `tools/my-tool.tool.ts`
2. Export `registerMyTool(server, services...)`
3. Add registration to `tools/index.ts`
4. Build and test

### Adding a New Service
1. Create `services/my-service.service.ts`
2. Export service class
3. Instantiate in `server.ts`
4. Inject into tools as needed

### Adding Configuration
1. Edit `config/environment.ts`
2. Add getter/parser function
3. Use in services/tools

## Testing

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Expected**: No TypeScript errors

### Runtime Test
```bash
npm start
```
**Expected**: Server starts, hubs load from .env

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
**Expected**: JSON response with server status

### Tool Test
Use MCP client to call tools and verify responses
